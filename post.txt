ğŸš€ Excited to share my Personal Expense Tracker Web App! ğŸš€

Iâ€™ve developed a simple yet powerful web application using Flask and SQLite that allows users to efficiently track their daily expenses. Features include:

ğŸ’¸ Add, View, and Delete Expenses
ğŸ“Š Generate Monthly Reports
ğŸ“ˆ CSV Export for Easy Data Handling
ğŸ“± Responsive Design for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop
ğŸ’µ Currency Formatted

This app is a great tool for anyone looking to stay on top of their finances, and itâ€™s built with a sleek, responsive UI using Materialize for modern design.

Check it out, and feel free to fork, modify, and contribute to the project! ğŸ”§
