# Personal Expense Tracker

The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a simple, yet effective web application built using **Flask** and **SQLite** that allows users to track and manage their daily expenses. It offers a user-friendly interface, enabling users to add, view, and delete expenses, with a CSV export feature to download all expenses as a report. The project also includes features like responsive design, dynamic table updates, and a monthly report generation.

## Features

- **Add Expense**: Allows users to add new expenses with fields for the date, category, description, and amount.
- **View Expenses**: Displays all expenses in a table format with the option to delete any expense.
- **CSV Export**: Users can export their expense data into a downloadable CSV file.
- **Responsive UI**: The application’s interface is responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Currency Formatting**: The application formats amounts as currency, including appropriate grouping and decimal places.
- **Monthly Reports**: Easily view a breakdown of expenses by category for the current month.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (Version 3.6 or higher)
- **Flask** (Web Framework)
- **SQLite** (Database)
- **Materialize** or **Bootstrap** (CSS Framework)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Personal-Expense-Tracker.git
   cd Personal-Expense-Tracker
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   Ensure that your database `expenses.db` is created and initialized. The first time you run the application, it will create the required tables. You can also set up the SQLite database manually if needed.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the application.

## How to Use

1. **Add Expense**:  
   On the homepage, use the "Add Expense" form to input a new expense. You'll need to provide:
   - Date of expense
   - Category (e.g., Food, Transport)
   - Description (e.g., Dinner at restaurant)
   - Amount (expense value)

2. **View Expenses**:  
   The table below the "Add Expense" form will show all previously entered expenses, with the most recent expenses at the top. You can see the Date, Category, Description, and Amount for each expense.

3. **Delete Expense**:  
   Each expense in the table has a "Delete" button. Clicking this will remove the expense from the database.

4. **Export to CSV**:  
   Use the "Export to CSV" button to download a CSV file of your expenses. This file can be opened with spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets.

5. **Monthly Report**:  
   The app automatically filters expenses to display them by month. You can also generate reports that categorize your expenses (e.g., showing how much you spent on Food, Transport, etc. in the current month).

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to create the web application.
- **SQLite**: A serverless, self-contained database used to store expenses.
- **Materialize/Bootstrap**: Front-end CSS frameworks used to style the UI and make it responsive.
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for rendering HTML and dynamic content.
- **Python**: Core programming language used for backend logic and handling CSV exports.

## Improvements and Future Enhancements

- **Authentication**: Add user authentication to allow for secure user logins and data segregation.
- **Expense Categories**: Allow users to create and manage custom expense categories.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Implement data visualizations like bar charts or pie charts to better understand spending trends.
- **Recurring Expenses**: Add functionality to track recurring monthly expenses and set reminders.
